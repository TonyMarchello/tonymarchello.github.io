                            I'm Anthony Marchello, a Software Engineering student at Milwaukee School of Engineering (MSOE),
                            pursuing a minor in Data Science. My academic focus combines software design, cybersecurity,
                            and data science to build robust and thoughtful applications.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Throughout the academic year, I've been working with Scot Forge on a year-long group project
                            developing a web application, applying tools like Python, Poetry, and React JS to solve real-world
                            problems while improving my skills in debugging, team collaboration, and technical debt reduction.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I'm experienced in full-stack development with technologies including Java, C++, MongoDB, SQL,
                            TensorFlow, and AWS. My projects span from deep learning character recognition to a Minesweeper
                            game clone, and a Culver's menu filtering app built with React JS and Bootstrap.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Outside of the classroom, I'm active in the MSOE community through Concert Band, the Video Game
                            Development Club, and Circle K. I also enjoy giving back through long-term volunteer roles at
                            St. Matthew's Church Choir and the Salvation Army.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When I'm not coding or studying, I enjoy reading, hiking, fishing, gaming with friends, and
                            diving into new ideas and creative projects. My broad interests help me stay curious,
                            adaptable, and eager to growâ€”both personally and professionally.
